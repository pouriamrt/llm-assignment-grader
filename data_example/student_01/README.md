# Number Stats – Submission

## Assignment

Write a Python script that reads a list of numbers and outputs their **sum** and **average**.

## How to run

- From command line with piped input:
  ```bash
  echo "10 20 30" | python solution.py
  ```
- Interactive: run `python solution.py`, enter one number per line, then press Ctrl+D (Unix) or Ctrl+Z (Windows).

## Design notes

- Numbers can be space-separated on one line or one per line.
- Non-numeric tokens are ignored.
- Exits with a clear message if no numbers are given.
