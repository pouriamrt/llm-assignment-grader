Stretchy Words - Submission (text only)

Requirements: Count how many query words can be extended to match string S.
Extension rule: a group of the same letter can be extended only if the final group has size >= 3.

I did not submit code. My approach would be:
1. Run-length encode S and each word.
2. For each word, check that each (char, count) group can match the corresponding group in S:
   - either same count, or S's count >= 3 and word's count <= S's count.

FSA: Would be deterministic, one state per "group" we're matching.

I ran out of time to implement. Sorry.
